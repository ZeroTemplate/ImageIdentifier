INTRODUCTION
------------

This project is a starting point for giving an example of how to find different
image files, based on the header data.
For now only JPG and BMP files are supported and the operations on those files
is not yet coded.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The only explicit requirement is a C++11 compatible compiler such as clang or gcc. The minimum required version of gcc is unknown, so if anyone has trouble building this with a specific version of gcc, do let me know.

* C++ Compiler with STL library

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation link to be added via github.io.
